# Daily Challenge, but MoonBit

This repo contains problems and solutions (with code) in [MoonBit OJ](https://oj.moonbitlang.com/problems])

As indicated in the repository title, I update at a rate of one problem per day, but I do not guarantee this frequency.

I belief that `Functional Programming` + `Competition Programming` will be funny. Let's start!
